# Team Hugo-Swag Team Agreement

Robert, Jackson, Carlos, Brooke

## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

- Brooke: My strength is working with data structures and planning out the flow of data. I think this could help with managing the queues for each room and with passing data between the server and the clients. I want to work on the professional competency of teamwork. I'm used to coding on my own, but the industry relies on groups of coders, so this is something I would like to get better at.

- Carlos: My strength is team collaboration, big picture planning, and adaptability.

- Jackson: My strength is algorithm solving as well as using socket.io in junction with helper functions to create 'paths' for a client to connect and use. I could use my abilities to ensure...

- Robert: I have had experience with some of the technologies used in the class. I'm also used to coding on my own, but I'd like to collaborate with others more. I am pretty good at debugging code and testing. If anyone wants to collaborate, we could use LiveShare to work on a problem together.

- How we want to make sure every person on the team understands all aspects of the project

  - code reviews everyday and on PRs
  - daily stand-ups and in the morning and midday to make sure we are on the same page

## Conflict Plan

- What will be the group's process for solving problems:
  - Someone can bring up the problem, we can talk about it as a group, if it's something we can't figure out as a team we can bring it up to a TA or Jacob
  
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project:
  - Tell that person that they are doing a lot and need to share the work with others so everyone can contribute, if this doesn't work then we can bring it up to a TA or Jacob

- How will you approach each other and teh challenges of the project knowing is is impossible for all members to be the same skill level:
  - We already talked about our strengths, we can try and to get people to do parts of the project that they are good at

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing:
  - Honesty, be open with the person who is not contributing and try to help them with whatever their struggling with

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful:
  - Ask a TA or Jacob to help step in and moderate whatever conflict we are having

## Communication Plan

  - Brooke: In class will be pretty easy, you can contact me over Slack after class
  - Carlos: I'm open from 9-5 on Slack or email
  
- What platforms will you use to communicate:
  - slack, email, in-person

- How often will you take breaks:
  - 50 minutes work, 10 minutes break

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind:
  - We are going to have a morning and lunch stand up, if we find that we are falling behind then we will discuss and reevaluate our minimum viable product as well as think about working after hours.

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend:
  - We don't plan on working on the weekends, and will communicate after hours on slack.

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard:
  - ask for everyone's input during stand up and everyone should explain their PRs so they communicate their ideas
