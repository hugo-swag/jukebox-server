# Team Hugo-Swag Team Agreement

## Cooperation Plan
- Brooke: My strength is working with data structures and planning out the flow of data. I think this could help with managing the queues for each room and with passing data between the server and the clients. I want to work on the professional competency of teamwork. I'm used to coding on my own, but the industry relies on groups of coders, so this is something I would like to get better at.

- Carlos: My strength is team collaboration, big picture planning, and adaptability.

- Jackson: My strength is algorithm solving as well as using socket.io in junction with helper functions to create 'paths' for a client to connect and use. I could use my abilities to ensure

- Robert: I have had experience with some of the technologies used in the class. I'm also used to coding on my own, but I'd like to collaborate with others more. I am pretty good at debugging code and testing. If anyone wants to collaborate, we could use LiveShare to work on a problem together.

- How we want to make sure every person on the team understands all aspects of the project
    - code reviews everyday and on PRs
    - daily stand-ups and in the morning and midday to make sure we are on the same page

  - Someone can bring up the problem, we can talk about it as a group, if it's something we can't figure out as a team we can bring it up to a TA or Jacob

  - Tell that person that they are doing a lot and need to share the work with others so everyone can contribute, if this doesn't work then we can bring it up to a TA or Jacob

- How will you approach each other and teh challenges of the project knowing is is impossible for all members to be the same skill level:
  - We already talked about our strengths, we can try and to get people to do parts of the project that they are good at

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing:
  - Honesty, be open with the person who is not contributing and try to help them with whatever their struggling with

    - We don't plan on working on the weekends, and will communicate after hours on slack.
